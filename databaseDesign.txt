For Database Design I have to think about the way the data communicates with each other to form larger functionalities on the frontend.
Example: Project Settings page
projectImage: Blob
projectName: string
demoUrl: url string
repositoryUrl: url
technologies: stringArray
description: string

Supabase lets me have string arrays as column for a table. that is useful. i don't need to make a separate table just for a column.

Users table
name:string
email:string
jobTitle:string
password:string
bio:string
coverImage:Blob
avatarImage:Blob
