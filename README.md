Devport: A Full Stack Development Project

Objective
- Devport was conceived as a comprehensive full stack project to consolidate and expand my skills as a developer.
- The aim was to create a platform where I could showcase my future projects in a shareable portfolio format.
- Additionally, the project evolved to provide a platform that others could use for their own personal portfolios, leading to the creation of Devport.


Architecture
- The project began with collaboration on the initial design with a UI designer, ensuring a strong visual foundation.
- Initially, I planned to start by designing the database schema, but soon realized the impossible challenge of anticipating all project requirements right from the start.
- That is why I decided to start with creating the API. Having chosen the REST protocol, it allowed me to work in a more iterative and dynamic development process.


Global Configuration and Components
- The next step involved analyzing the design to identify global styles and configurations, as well as distinct UI components.
- I established global variables and implemented all global configurations for the project.
- A detailed list of reusable UI components, project-specific components, and page components was created after analysing the UI design.
- The step above help me make a mental model of the work involved and help me start the development process.


Challenges and Lessons Learned
- I encountered challenges with the styling approach, using both Tailwind CSS and CSS modules, which complicated the implementation of dark mode.
- Key realization: It's crucial to choose a single styling methodology for consistency, either global styles with Tailwind CSS or CSS modules, but not both.
- The project also faced delays due to indecision about certain design functionalities.
- Important takeaway: Finalize decisions on functionality early to avoid costly reworks and ensure efficient development.
- Hosting the project presented difficulties, particularly in finding a suitable free-tier platform for a full stack application.
